                    <li>As a proud TAMU ambassador, I have the privilege of visiting high schools each semester, sharing the spirit and opportunities of Texas A&M with future Aggies. It's incredibly rewarding to inspire students and help them envision their own journeys in higher education.</li>
                    <li>Participating in the Big Event, I join hundreds of volunteers to help beautify and restore local parks, making a tangible difference in our community. The camaraderie and sense of purpose during these events are truly uplifting.</li>
                    <li>Giving back to the Bryan community, I regularly volunteer at the local foodbank, helping to sort, pack, and distribute food to families in need. These experiences have deepened my appreciation for service and the impact of collective action.</li>

This once-in-a-lifetime event was a celebration of unity and vision, and I was honored to play a key role in its success.</li>
                    <li>Over several months, I managed communications with a diverse array of vendors, meticulously coordinating the logistics for all technological equipmentâ€”microphones, LED screens, and speakers. My focus was on securing the best deals and ensuring everything arrived on schedule, contributing to a seamless production.</li>
                    <li>With careful planning and attention to detail, I helped create an unforgettable experience for over 2,000 attendees at peak times, ensuring the event ran smoothly and every guest felt welcomed and engaged. The energy and excitement of the crowd made all our hard work worthwhile.</li>
